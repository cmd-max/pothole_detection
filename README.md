Introduction
Potholes are a common road hazard that can lead to accidents and vehicle damage. This Jupyter Notebook provides an algorithm to automatically detect potholes in images, enabling early intervention and maintenance.

Getting Started
To get started, make sure you have Python installed along with the required dependencies. You can install the dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Next, open the Pothole_Detection.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Dependencies
The algorithm utilizes the following libraries:

OpenCV
NumPy
Matplotlib
These dependencies can be installed using the provided requirements.txt file.

Usage
Open the Pothole_Detection.ipynb notebook.
Upload an image containing a road scene with potential potholes.
Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to preprocess the image and apply the pothole detection algorithm.
Visualize the detected potholes and their locations in the image.
Algorithm
The pothole detection algorithm involves the following steps:

Image Preprocessing: The input image is preprocessed to enhance relevant features and reduce noise.
Edge Detection: Edges in the image are detected using edge detection techniques.
Contour Detection: Contours are identified in the edge-detected image.
Pothole Classification: Contours are analyzed to determine if they represent potential potholes based on certain criteria.
Pothole Localization: The algorithm locates the potholes and marks their positions on the original image.
Results
The algorithm provides visual feedback by highlighting detected potholes in the input image. Detected potholes are outlined and labeled for easy identification.
